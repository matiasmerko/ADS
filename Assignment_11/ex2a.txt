I will show this by giving a counter example;
Activity 1: s=2 f=3 => also the shortest activity
Activity 2: s=0 f=2
Activity 3: s=2 f=6
The algorithm will pick activity 1 and will not be able 
pick any other activities if it does so. On the other hand,
if we used the proper greedy method, it would choose activity 2 and 3
